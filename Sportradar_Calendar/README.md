# Sportradar Coding Academy, Coding Exercise / FlexCalendar / Sportradar_Calendar

## About 

* I did frontend user-friendly webpage to implement my vision for a calendar for sport events, where the users or organisations can add events. Everyone who wants to add event must first write his First Name, Second Name and Email. Then it will be possible to add some information about the event - sport, team, date and time. Also can be possible to change the event status - active, cancelled or past. Days with events will be mark with ,,+''. To see the event you can click on it. 

* Project status: still working on it/prototype. 
* What will i do next: Navigation (now only indicated, but not fuctionality). LogIn/SignIn. Flip the Calendar to the back side (with JavaScript), where there will be info for the event and Add Event button will be moved on calendar's backside. Swipe between another months and years.
